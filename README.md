# Scala JWT

JWT support for Scala. Pick the best project depending on your need...

## Core

Low-level API based mostly based on String and Map since there is no native support for JSON in Scala.

## Play JSON

Nice API to interact with JWT using JsObject from the Play JSON lib.

## Play

Built in top of Play JSON, extend the `Result` class in order to allow you to manage the `Session` using JWT.

## Json4s

Work in progress...
